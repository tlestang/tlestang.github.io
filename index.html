	  Hi there, I'm a Research Software Engineer at the University Of Oxford, UK.
	  I collaborate on various scientific software projects with researchers across Oxford (and the Channel), bringing software engineering expertise to the research project.
	</p>
	<p>
	  I'm working to raise the profile of research software in academia, both locally at Oxford and globally. I'm not alone! I'm surrounded by great colleagues at the <a href="https://www.rse.ox.ac.uk/">Oxford Research Software Engineering group</a>, and an amazing <a href="https://researchsoftware.org/">RSE community</a> both at the national and international levels. If you're in Oxford, check out our (free) regular <a href="https://www.rse.ox.ac.uk/training/">training courses</a>, where we teach research staff and graduate students the software engineering required to make their research more reproducible, efficient and open. I'm also a fellow of <a href="https://ox.ukrn.org/">Reproducible Research Oxford</a>. Finally, I recently initiated the <a href="https://github.com/OxfordCodeReviewNet/forum">Oxford Code Review Network</a>, that makes it easy for local researchers to get in touch with colleagues across the University to carry out code reviews.

	  I hold a PhD in Physics from Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon (2018), during which I investigated the application of rare envent sampling algorithms to the simulation of extreme events in turbulent flows around objects. You can learn more about that research <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-fluid-mechanics/article/numerical-study-of-extreme-mechanical-force-exerted-by-a-turbulent-flow-on-a-bluff-body-by-direct-and-rareevent-sampling-techniques/AF7125593B78B17A8CA9958E0985D55B">here</a>.
