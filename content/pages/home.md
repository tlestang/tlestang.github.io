I am a Senior Research Software Engineer in the Department of
Aeronautics at Imperial College London. I work hand in hand with
researchers in the department to maintain and develop open source flow
solvers like [Nektar++](https://www.nektar.info/),
[PyFR](https://www.pyfr.org/) and
[xcompact3d](https://github.com/xcompact3d). At the same time, I am active across
the department to support and train researchers in research software
engineering, and promote/enable efficient and sustainable software
development practices.

I was previously a Research Software Engineer in the [Oxford Research
Software Engineering group](https://www.rse.ox.ac.uk), and a Junior
Research Fellow at Kellogg College, University of Oxford. I
collaborated on various scientific software projects, from battery
mathematical modelling to screening visual impairment in patients
after stroke. I hold a PhD in Physics from Ecole Normale Sup√©rieure de
Lyon (2018), during which I investigated the application of rare event
sampling algorithms to the simulation of extreme events in turbulent
flows around objects.

I'm generally interested in raising the profile of research software
- and the people who write it - whether it is at Imperial College
London, in the UK, or worldwide. I am 2021 [Software Sustainability
Institute](https://www.software.ac.uk/) fellow.

Topics I am particularly interested in include

reproducible research;code review;refactoring;GNU Emacs;org-mode;Python packaging;parallel programming;computational fluid dynamics
