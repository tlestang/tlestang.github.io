Hi there, I'm a Research Software Engineer at the University Of Oxford, UK.
I collaborate on various scientific software projects with researchers across Oxford, bringing software engineering expertise to academic research projects.

I'm working to raise the profile of research software in academia, both locally at Oxford and globally.
I'm not alone!
I'm surrounded by great colleagues at the [Oxford Research Software Engineering group](https://www.rse.ox.ac.uk), and an amazing [RSE community](https://researchsoftware.org) both at the national and international levels.
If you're in Oxford, check out our (free) regular [training courses](https://www.rse.ox.ac.uk/training), where we teach research staff and graduate students the software engineering required to make their research more reproducible, efficient and open.

I am a Junior Research Fellow of [Kellogg College Oxford](https://www.kellogg.ox.ac.uk) and a 2021-2022 fellow of the [Software Sustainability Institute](https://www.software.ac.uk/about/fellows). I initiated the [Oxford Code Review Network](https://github.com/OxfordCodeReviewNet/forum), that makes it easy for local researchers to get in touch with colleagues across the University to carry out code reviews.
I'm also involved with the [Reproducible Research Oxford](https://ox.ukrn.org) network.

I hold a PhD in Physics from Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon (2018), during which I investigated the application of rare event sampling algorithms to the simulation of extreme events in turbulent flows around objects. You can learn more about that research [here](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-fluid-mechanics/article/numerical-study-of-extreme-mechanical-force-exerted-by-a-turbulent-flow-on-a-bluff-body-by-direct-and-rareevent-sampling-techniques/AF7125593B78B17A8CA9958E0985D55B).
