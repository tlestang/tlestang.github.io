Code reviewing is a standard practice among professional software
developers. Generally, this means code is subject to human feedback,
complementary to machine â€¦&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;div id="table-of-contents"&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id="orgcebeb00"&gt;&lt;span class="section-number-2"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; Research software isn't reviewed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Code reviewing is a standard practice among professional software
developers. Generally, this means code is subject to human feedback,
complementary to machine feedback such as output from compilers,
automatic linters and test runners. Code reviews are most useful to
look at aspects of software quality for which feedback cannot be
automated, such as software design or code readability.  In these
cases, human feedback is crucial to ensure that the code is written in
a way that facilitates its study and reuse by other developers. In a
commercial context, this could mean ensuring that the software remains
easy to maintain, update and extend.  Therefore, code reviewing
is ultimately about software sustainability.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Code reviews also are a key component of open source software
development.  Organised around platforms such as GitHub or GitLab,
contributors to open source projects propose and discuss their
contributions publicly. At the core of this development model is the
simple idea that contributed code isn't set in stone, and that
several rounds of feedback from other project contributors will be
necessary for it the be ready to be integrated into the project's
codebase.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Meanwhile, in academia, research code is almost never reviewed.
Despite the ever-increasing reliance of modern research on software,
software quality remains a widely overlooked topic, if not completely
ignored.  This is because research software is rarely the end product,
as opposed to the scientific results (e.g figures and tables) that it
generates.  On top of that, the highly competitive, publication
rate-based funding model is not particularly rewarding to researchers
ready to dedicate time to writing good software.  In fact, spending
too much effort into software development is often considered harmful
to a researcher's career development, as it is detrimental to their
publication rate.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="outline-container-orgfa4e79b" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="orgfa4e79b"&gt;&lt;span class="section-number-2"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; Researchers &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; developers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In 2021, the situation is slowly evolving, and has been so over the
past few years.  The "reproducibility crisis" opened many people's
eyes (and continues to do so) to the fact that a significant number of
research findings, in a wide range of disciplines, cannot be
reproduced by an independent team of researchers.  A common cause of
non-reproducibility is software issues, for instance the code being
unavailable, or left in an unusable state after the main paper was
published. Although some journals and funding bodies nowadays require
associated code(s) to be made available at the time of publication,
the large majority of research software is still written by temporary
staff (graduate students or post-doctoral researchers), without formal
training in software engineering, often operating under high
pressure. As a result, an increasing number of researchers experience
the deep frustration of having to build upon poorly written,
undocumented, and untested software. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
One upshot is that this results to an increasing awareness that
cutting corners regarding software quality is counter productive, as
this actually &lt;i&gt;slows down&lt;/i&gt; research in the long run&amp;#x2026; as well as in
the short run.  In most cases, unfortunately, the gap in software
engineering knowledge is simply too big to fill for researchers,
especially for those isolated and/or working in research groups where
a suitable software engineering culture isn't established, and where
mentors cannot be found and where feedback isn't available.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
As &lt;a href="https://www.rse.ox.ac.uk/rse_post/survey_results/"&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt; conducted at the University of Oxford in 2018 shows that,
among 375 scientists, 75% declared they could do with expert software
engineering help.  The first training course organised by the Oxford
Research Software Engineering group for researchers at Oxford,
focusing on version control, was fully booked in about 20 minutes (~
30 seats), despite very limited advertising.  This illustrates that a
large majority of researchers are not happy with the way research
software is developed, and there is often a consensus on the fact
that "there must be a better way of doing this".  Training courses are
part of the solution, but cannot be the whole of it. The research
community must seize software development as part and parcel of the
research effort, as opposed to view it as a foreign activity that
researchers can only be amateurs in.  Researchers &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; software
developers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="outline-container-orgdd34a41" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="orgdd34a41"&gt;&lt;span class="section-number-2"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt; Code reviewing is not bug-hunting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Consequently, it should be common practice for researchers to "talk
code". Currently, the opposite is true, as most research software is
written in isolation, almost hidden from others' gaze, in fear that
the author's (self-assessed) low programming skills will be exposed.
On the one hand, and to put it mildly, it is true that a large
portion of research software could be written in a better way.  On the
other hand, researchers tend to be too harsh on themselves, by
forgetting (or not being aware of the fact that) writing quality code
is an iterative process that greatly benefits from other people's
input &amp;#x2013; especially when the original author has limited software
engineering experience themselves.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This is a call for code reviewing in academia.  Instead of hiding
analysis scripts, hoping nobody will notice they are unreadable for
anyone outside the project, these should be reviewed by other
researchers on a regular basis all along their development.  Done
regularly, code reviewing doesn't come with a large overhead: an hour
every week, for instance spent sitting with a colleague to review the
latest modifications.  In this way, participating in code reviews
should join the list of the many activities that make up the day of
academics.  There is a lot to be gained in reviewing a colleague'
code: new ways of writing software, programming tricks or elegant
designs, but also a refresher on things to avoid, such as bad naming
or monster functions.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It is worth stressing that beginner programmers can make very good
reviewers, and therefore reviewing isn't limited to researchers with
substantial programming experience.  Generally, the purpose of code
reviewing &amp;#x2013; at least in academia &amp;#x2013; is not to catch bugs or
programming mistakes. To some extent, machines can already help with
this.  Rather, the purpose of a code review is to flag up those things
that make the code difficult to read, debug, reuse and extend. From a
software sustainability and research reproducibility point of view, it
is crucial that even researchers with limited experience in software,
or simply limited experience in that specific programming language,
are able to understand the program.  Beginner programmers are
therefore well placed to review research software and should
feel encouraged to do so.  And of course, reviewing "real-life"
research code makes for a fantastic learning opportunity for them.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="outline-container-orgc14740e" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="orgc14740e"&gt;&lt;span class="section-number-2"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt; Distributing knowledge and experience&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In academia, programming and software engineering skills are both
scarce and unevenly distributed.  This is true at the level of both
individuals and academic disciplines.  In this context, another
purpose of code reviewing is knowledge transfer.  At the scale of a
research group, regular code reviews between all members will ensure
that members with the least software experience benefit from the
knowledge of more seasoned members of the group, learn from them, and
in turn become mentors for others.  If several members are involved in
a common project, regular code reviews spread knowledge of the
codebase across the team.  This means more independent teammates, as
well as more efficient and fruitful teamwork. But above all, it
prevents the codebase from falling apart as some members of the team move
on to work on other projects.  With regular code reviews, there will
always be someone in the group who is able to mentor new recruits.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Going beyond research groups, code reviewing has the potential to
spread software engineering practices across disciplines.  As many
computational approaches are common to several fields, a biologist may
be well suited to provide insightful feedback on the readability and
modularity of a code written by a physicist, and &lt;i&gt;vice versa&lt;/i&gt;.
Interdisciplinary code reviews enable knowledge transfer at
a larger scale, enriching different research communities from one
another's experience and practices.  This is one of the core
motivations behind the &lt;a href="https://github.com/OxfordCodeReviewNet/forum"&gt;Oxford Code Review Network&lt;/a&gt;, an initiative at the University of Oxford
that promotes and facilitates code reviews between researchers across
the university. Code reviews involving researchers from different
fields are particularly important since few communities boast the greatest
concentration of programming and software engineering skills (for instance
particle physics), and democratising interdisciplinary code reviews
would make the rest of the research community benefit from that
expertise.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In a world where research software is recognised as a key component of
research, code reviews would certainly be a widespread practice among
academics, just like it is for commercial software developers.
At the same time, democratising code reviewing in academia would help
driving the culture change required for software development to be
considered a key part of a researcher's activities, as well as making
software sustainability a core concern of quality research.  Short,
regular code reviews provide an opportunity for researchers to "talk
code", both teaching or learning from colleagues. Although these
meetings can go relatively unnoticed in researcher's daily schedule,
they greatly impact the readability, debugability and reusability of
research software.  
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Why is that important? Because poor software quality cripples
research, in both the short and long term.  By contrast, quality
software accelerates research: it makes it more efficient,
more open, more collaborative and more reproducible.  Code reviews
also spread programming and software engineering experience,
contributing to the education of future generations of researchers and
making research teams more resilient to change.  And with an
increasing number of research fields heavily relying on software
development, code reviews enable knowledge transfer across
disciplines.  This can lead to the adoption of new practices inspired
from other fields of research, but also to transdisciplinary research
collaborations&amp;#x2026; what's not to like about this?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
